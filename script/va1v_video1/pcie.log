 Processor Counter Monitor: PCIe Bandwidth Monitoring Utility 
 This utility measures PCIe bandwidth in real-time

 PCIe event definitions (each event counts as a transfer): 
   PCIe read events (PCI devices reading from memory - application writes to disk/network/PCIe device):
     PCIePRd   - PCIe UC read transfer (partial cache line)
     PCIeRdCur* - PCIe read current transfer (full cache line)
         On Haswell Server PCIeRdCur counts both full/partial cache lines
     RFO*      - Demand Data RFO
     CRd*      - Demand Code Read
     DRd       - Demand Data Read
     PCIeNSWr  - PCIe Non-snoop write transfer (partial cache line)
   PCIe write events (PCI devices writing to memory - application reads from disk/network/PCIe device):
     PCIeWiLF  - PCIe Write transfer (non-allocating) (full cache line)
     PCIeItoM  - PCIe Write transfer (allocating) (full cache line)
     PCIeNSWr  - PCIe Non-snoop write transfer (partial cache line)
     PCIeNSWrF - PCIe Non-snoop write transfer (full cache line)
     ItoM      - PCIe write full cache line
     RFO       - PCIe partial Write
   CPU MMIO events (CPU reading/writing to PCIe devices):
     PRd       - MMIO Read [Haswell Server only] (Partial Cache Line)
     WiL       - MMIO Write (Full/Partial)
